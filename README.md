# cc2-finalchallenge-5

Objective:

In this assignment, you will apply your knowledge of exception handling by solving two real-life problems. You will select any two of the three provided problems and create solutions that demonstrate proper exception handling. Each solution should include custom exceptions where applicable, along with clear, user-friendly output.
Problem Options:

    Banking System - Insufficient Funds Exception: Implement a program that allows users to withdraw from their bank account. If the withdrawal amount exceeds the current balance, the program should throw a custom InsufficientFundsException and display a message informing the user.

    Online Shopping Cart - Invalid Product Quantity: Write a program for an online shopping cart where users input a product quantity. If the quantity is negative or exceeds available stock, throw a custom InvalidQuantityException to handle this error gracefully.

    Flight Booking System - No Seats Available Exception: Design a flight booking system that lets users attempt to book a seat. If the flight is fully booked, throw a custom NoSeatsAvailableException and inform the user that no seats are available.

Instructions:

    Select and Implement: Choose two of the three problems listed above. Implement a solution for each selected problem, creating a separate program for each.

    Define Custom Exceptions: For each problem, define a custom exception class (e.g., InsufficientFundsException, InvalidQuantityException, or NoSeatsAvailableException) to handle the specific error condition described in the problem.

    Implement Exception Handling: Use try-catch blocks in each program to handle the custom exceptions and display informative messages to the user when errors occur.

    User-Friendly Output: Ensure that your program provides clear and informative output, guiding the user through the input process and explaining any errors that are caught.
